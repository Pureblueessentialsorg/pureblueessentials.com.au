Through our packaging we aim to achieve 3 things:

* To ensure your precious cargo arrives in perfect condition;

* To have minimal impact on the environment while conducting an ongoing business and meaningful employment;

* To support sustainable packaging companies; and

* To save recyclable materials from ending up in landfill.

We encourage you to recycle all our packaging the most effective way in your local area.

Our blue and white Hero Packaging mailers can be used for posting again. Yes, really! And they are fully commercial and home compostable

If you have packing peanuts (the squidgy white puffs) in your parcel, they can safely be placed in any commercial or home composting system or placed on the garden and watered in straight away.

If you canâ€™t do either of those, it is safe to place them in the kitchen sink and wash them down the drain with ample water.

If your packaging does include soft plastics they can easily be recycled through the wonderful redcycle initiative at many, many participating stores.
