**Four Thieves Remedial Oil Blend**

**History:**

An essential oil blend believed to be created by four thieves in the 15th century to protect themselves from the plague, while robbing the sick and dying. When caught, the authorities offered to lighten their sentence if they disclosed how they escaped catching the plague during their plundering efforts. So they handed over their formula of oils.
