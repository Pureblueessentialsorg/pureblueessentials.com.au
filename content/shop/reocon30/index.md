This blend is a dreamy, uplifting blend to help you embrace a good day, or help a bad day get better.

If sadness, apathy or depression is creeping in, seek professional help if appropriate but also get your hands on our **Contentment** remedial essential oil blend.

Jasmine is known for improving confidence, promoting optimism and is soothing and euphoric.

Lemon, spearmint, grapefruit and nutmeg are all uplifting and reviving. Myrtle is very relaxing for the nervous system and may combat depression.

Cedar completes the blend by adding fortifying and calming properties and may help to reduce fear.

This 30ml bottle contains 100% pure essential oils. Shake well before use.

It can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- use in an essential oil diffuser

\- add to a warm bath

\- use in home-made lotions or balms

Also available in a 10ml bottle containing 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin.

**Cautions:**

Keep away from eyes and mouth. If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
