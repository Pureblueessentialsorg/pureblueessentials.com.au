If sadness, apathy or depression is creeping in, seek professional help if appropriate but also get your hands on our **Contentment** remedial essential oil blend.

Jasmine is known for improving confidence, promoting optimism and is soothing and euphoric.  Lemon, spearmint, grapefruit and nutmeg are all uplifting and reviving.  Myrtle is very relaxing for the nervous system and may combat depression.  Cypress completes the blend by adding fortifying and grounding properties.

Also available in a 10ml bottle containing 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin.
