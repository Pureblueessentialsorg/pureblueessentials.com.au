We are pleased to be able to provide you with refillable 10ml bottles that are safe for essentials oils.

They are high quality and environmentally friendly, with a glass bottle in a bamboo casing and a stainless steel roller. The only plastic component is the bottle top and lid thread, providing a leak-proof seal.

Keep your favourites on hand in multiple places by blending your own essential oil formula, topping up your **pure blue essentials** blend, or a single essential oil.

**Cautions:**

Essential oils should only be applied to the skin when diluted in a carrier oil.

Essential oils are for external use only. Do not ingest.  Keep essential oils away from eyes and mouth. 

If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
