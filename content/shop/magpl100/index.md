Often referred to as a magnesium “oil”, the **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub PLUS is a liquid solution of magnesium chloride salts and is hand made by us. This blend has been fortified with the added benefits of lavender and lemongrass essential oils.

In addition to their remedial properties, the lavender and lemongrass essentials oils can’t help but make you feel relaxed with their dreamy, calming scents.

The Magnesium Rub PLUS has an unusual feel when rubbed it in to the skin, somewhat similar to an oil, but with a residual “silky, salty” feel.  If you don't like the residual feel, leave on the skin for 30mins then wipe of with a damp cloth.  It will have absorbed through the skin in this time.

Shake well before use.  Apply **pure blue essentials** **Magnesium Rub PLUS** to muscles that are prone to cramping and over-exertion, or to muscles that feel tired or sore.

**Ingredients:** Magnesium chloride concentrate, filtered water, lavender essential oil, lemongrass essential oil,  emulsifier (polysorbate 20).
