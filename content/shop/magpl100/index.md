Often referred to as a magnesium “oil”, the **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub is a liquid solution of magnesium chloride salts with added essential oils that also help to relieve the symptoms of tired, sore muscles.

It is hand made by us and has an unusual feel when rubbing it in to the skin, somewhat similar to an oil, but with a residual “silky, salty” feel.

Apply **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub to muscles that are prone to cramping and over-exertion, or to muscles that feel tired or sore.

In addition to their remedial properties, the lavender and lemongrass essentials oils can’t help but make you feel relaxed with their exotically relaxing scents.

Ingredients: Magnesium chloride concentrate, filtered water, emulsifier (polysorbate 20 derived from plants), lavender essential oil, lemongrass essential oil.
