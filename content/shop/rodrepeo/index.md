I﻿f you want a natural solution to repel rodents in and around your home, choose this mix of 100% pure essential oils.  

C﻿ontaining a mix of cedar and clove peppermint essential oils, rodents will stay well away from any area where you use this essential oil blend.  Protect food, clothes, ceiling spaces, sheds and workshops and storage areas.  It's extremely effective - rodents won't visit, they won't settle and they won't make a nest.  

 The bottle has a dropper to make it easy to use. 

Place a few drops on oil-resistant surfaces in outdoor areas.  In cupboards, use drops on a tissue or cloth, then place on an oil-resistant surface or peg onto a piece of cord.  Replenish when the scent isn't perceptible anymore.
