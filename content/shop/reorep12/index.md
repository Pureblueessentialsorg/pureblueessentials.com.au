**The Resilience Pack -** A wonderful gift idea, or a complete remedial essential oil arsenal at your disposal.

12 x 10ml Remedial Essential Oils.  Pay for 10, get 2 for free!

The blends are: Arthritis, Balance, Calm, Clarity, Contentment, Energise, Four Thieves, Headache Help, PMS Lift, Strain-sprain-pain, Sleep Right and Wound Care.

This covers all your health support needs and each 10ml bottles contains 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blends are ready to be safely applied to the skin.

If the “PMS lift” doesn’t apply to you, let us know in the notes at checkout and we will swap it out for another of your choice of the other 11. 

The 12 pure blue essentials remedial oil blends are also available in 30mls bottles of 100% pure essentials without carrier oil.  The 30ml equivalent of the Resilience Pack is the **Pure Blue Luxury Pack**, or they are available individually (hyperlink).   

**Cautions:** 

Keep away from eyes and mouth. For external use only. Do not ingest.  

Some blends contain essential oils that are not suitable to be used when pregnant or breast-feeding.

If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
