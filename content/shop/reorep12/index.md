**The Resilience Pack**

12 x 10ml Remedial Essential Oils.  Pay for 10, get 2 for free!

Arthritis, Balance, Calm, Clarity, Contentment, Energise, Four Thieves, Headache Help, PMS Lift, Strain-sprain-pain, Sleep Right, Wound Care

To cover all your health support needs and ready to use on the skin.  A wonderful gift idea, or a complete remedial essential oil arsenal at your disposal.

If the “PMS lift” doesn’t apply to you, let us know in the notes at checkout and we will swap it out for another of your choice of the other 11.

All these 10ml bottles contains 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin.

The 12 pure blue essentials remedial oil blends are also available in 30mls bottles of 100% pure essentials without carrier oil.  The 30ml equivalent of the Resilience Pack is the **Pure Blue Luxury Pack**, or they are available individually.   

**Cautions:** 

Keep away from eyes and mouth. For external use only. Do not ingest.

If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
