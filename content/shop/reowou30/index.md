**Wound Care** remedial essential oil blend is an extremely helpful blend to have on hand, both at home and on the move, as a high grade topical oil to treat cuts, grazes, stings and other wounds.

It contains lavender, arnica, tea tree, helichrysum essential oils, calendula infusion and plant-derived vitamin e oil

Lavender and tea tree have antiseptic and analgesic properties, while arnica, calendula, vitamin e and helichrysum are potent repairers of skin, epidermal and vascular tissue.

The helichrysum and calendula give the oil a bright, sun-yellow hue to the blend.

This 30ml bottle contains 100% pure essential oils. Shake well before use.

It can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- use in an essential oil diffuser

\- add to a warm bath

\- use in home-made lotions or balms

Also available in  a 10ml bottle containing 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin. 

After more value for money? The **Wound Care value bundle** contains:

\- a 30ml bottle of this remedial essential oil blend;

\- 30ml bottle of jojoba oil (carrier oil);

\- 10ml bottle (glass with bamboo casing) to refill with your **Wound Care** blend and carrier oil many times over.
