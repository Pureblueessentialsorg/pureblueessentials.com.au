Lavender and chamomile have long been used to help induce a good nightâ€™s sleep, acting as relaxants and calmatives for the body and the mind.

Added to these dependables are bergamot, frankincense, geranium and cypress which also help to calm and relax the mind.

The **Sleep Right** blend can promote a healthy sleep pattern - to calm your mind at bedtime, to stay asleep and to promote deeper, restorative sleep, leading to feeling less stressed upon waking and ready for the day.
