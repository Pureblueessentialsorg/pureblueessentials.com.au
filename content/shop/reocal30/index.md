With a combination of orange, tangerine, ylang ylang, patchouli and chamomile, the **Calm** remedial essential oil blend uses the relaxing citrus tones of orange and tangerine, the rich heady scents of ylang ylang and patchouli, and the gentle but effective chamomile to create a soothing, calming blend for your central nervous system.

This 30ml bottle contains 100% pure essential oils. Shake well before use.

It can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- use in an essential oil diffuser

\- add to a warm bath

\- use in home-made lotions or balms

Also available in a 10ml bottle containing 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin.

If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
