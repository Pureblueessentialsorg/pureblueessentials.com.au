The piquant combination of basil, rosemary, peppermint, lemon and bergamot in the **Clarity** remedial essential oil blend helps to clear the mind and increase levels of concentration. The citrus and rosemary elements provide uplifting properties. Basil and peppermint are mentally stimulating.

This is a great essential oil blend to use in an oil diffuser or essential oil burner when studying, or to use on pulse points on the body (underside of wrists, inside of elbow, temples, either side of neck) when public speaking, preparing for an interview.

It can also be very useful when recovering from an illness or condition where brain-fog and/or fatigue are symptoms.

This 10ml bottle contains 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin. Shake well before use.

Also available in a 30ml bottle containing 100% pure essential oils that can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- use in an essential oil diffuser

\- add to a warm bath

\- use in home-made lotions or balms

**Cautions:**

Do not use if pregnant, breastfeeding or on infants under 12 months old.

Keep away from eyes and mouth. If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
