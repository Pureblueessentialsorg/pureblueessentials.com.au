2Arthritis is experienced by approximately [3.9 million](https://arthritisaustralia.com.au/what-is-arthritis/fastfacts/) [Australians](https://arthritisaustralia.com.au/what-is-arthritis/fastfacts/). It is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the bones, joints and sometimes muscles. Arthritis causes physiological changes in a joint and symptoms usually range from stiffness, swelling, redness and pain. It often occurs in hands, feet, knees, neck and hips but can occur in any joint. The inflammation and swelling from arthritis in a joint can lead to changes in adjacent muscles.

The essential oils in **“I said no Arthr”** are known to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with Arthritis. They can help alleviate swelling, reduce inflammation and ease muscle tension.

Ginger and frankincense are the most effective essential oils for arthritis, both basil and eucalyptus are anti-inflammatory and analgesic, and orange is anti-inflammatory and calming. Turmeric is anti-inflammatory and lavender is a calmative.

In areas of the body prone to arthritis, rub into the skin generously with a carrier oil.

Alternatively, add 10 or 12 drops to a warm bath.

This 30ml bottle contains 100% pure essential oils that can be used in a variety of ways, including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

Also available in a 10ml bottle containing 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin.
