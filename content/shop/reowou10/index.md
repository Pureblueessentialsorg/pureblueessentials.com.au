**Wound Care** remedial essential oil blend is an extremely helpful blend to have on hand, both at home and on the move, as a high grade topical oil to treat cuts, grazes, stings and other wounds.**Cautions:**

It contains lavender, arnica, tea tree, helichrysum essential oils, calendula infusion and plant-derived vitamin e oil

Lavender and tea tree have antiseptic and analgesic properties, while arnica, calendula, vitamin e and helichrysum are potent repairers of skin, epidermal and vascular tissue.

The helichrysum and calendula give the oil a bright, sun-yellow hue to the blend.
