This is one of our favourite luxury products! Pure Australian jojoba oil.  

Jojoja oil is not technically an oil but a liquid wax so, compared to other seed oils, it has an extremely long shelf life.

Its a very high quality carrier oil for essential oils.  Silky and non-greasy, its well suited as the only oil you need for moisturising your face or body.  For added luxury, it can also be used as the main ingredient when making your own zero waste skin care products.

It makes a high quality oil for remedial or relaxation massage oil (with or without essential oils).  

The golden jojoba oil we source is grown in Australia without pesticides.  The liquid wax extract is cold pressed with no chemicals and filtered to 1 micron.  

All our **pure blue essential** 10ml **remedial essential oil blends** contain 30% of this high quality jojoba oil as a carrier oil, so the blends are ready to safely apply to the skin.
