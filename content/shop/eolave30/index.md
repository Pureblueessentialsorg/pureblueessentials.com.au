Arguably the most common essential oil used today.  However, common doesn't mean boring !

Lavender has analgesic, antiseptic and calmative qualities and an unmistakable aroma.

Please contact us if you are wanting amounts of more than 30mls.



**Cautions:**

Keep away from eyes and mouth. For external use only. Do not ingest.

If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
