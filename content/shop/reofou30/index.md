What a strange name you say....  Four Thieves....

If you know the long history of the **Four Thieves** essential oil formula, here is the blend!

If you're not familiar with the history - in short - during the Black Plague in medieval times, 4 thieves managed to rob the sick and dying without catching the plague themselves. When they were eventually caught, the authorities offered to lighten their sentences if they revealed their secret formula.

Whether the fable is true or not, this essential oil formula has been used for many centuries as an anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal, even before they were named as such pathogens.

With a quite intense aroma (think zingy chai spice) it contains clove, lemon, cinnamon, eucalyptus and rosemary essential oils.

As well as using in dilution on the body, the Four Thieves blend can be used to treat mould and bacteria on many surfaces.

This 30ml bottle containing 100% pure essential oils that can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- add a few drops to a warm bath, or a few drops on your feet in the shower
