Often referred to as a magnesium “oil”, the **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub is a liquid solution of magnesium chloride salts and is hand made by us. 

It has an unusual feel when rubbed it in to the skin, somewhat similar to an oil, but with a residual “silky, salty” feel.  If you don't like the residual feel, leave on the skin for 30mins then wipe of with a damp cloth.  It will have absorbed through the skin in this time.

Apply **pure blue essentials** **Magnesium Rub** to muscles that are prone to cramping and over-exertion, or to muscles that feel tired or sore.

Shake well before use.
