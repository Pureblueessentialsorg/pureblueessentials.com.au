Often referred to as a magnesium “oil”, the **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub is a liquid solution of magnesium chloride salts.

It is hand made by us and has an unusual feel when rubbing it in to the skin, somewhat similar to an oil, but with a residual “salty” feel.

Apply **pure blue essentials** Magnesium Rub to muscles that are prone to cramping and over-exertion, or to muscles that feel tired or sore.
