This blend is a dreamy, uplifting blend to help you embrace a good day, or help a bad day get better.

If sadness, apathy or depression is creeping in, seek professional help if appropriate but also get your hands on our **Contentment** remedial essential oil blend.

Jasmine is known for improving confidence, promoting optimism and is soothing and euphoric.

Lemon, spearmint, grapefruit and nutmeg are all uplifting and reviving. Myrtle is very relaxing for the nervous system and may combat depression.

Cypress completes the blend by adding fortifying and grounding properties.

This 10ml bottle contains 30% high quality carrier oil (pure Australia jojoba oil) so the remedial essential oil blend is ready to be safely applied to the skin. Shake well before use.

\
Also available in a 30ml bottle containing 100% pure essential oils that can be used in a variety of ways including:

\- add to your own carrier oil

\- use in an essential oil diffuser

\- add to a warm bath

\- use in home-made lotions or balms

**Cautions:**

Keep away from eyes and mouth. If skin, eye or nasal irritation occurs, discontinue use.
