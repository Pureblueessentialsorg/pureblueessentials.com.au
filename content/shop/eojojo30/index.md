This is one of our favourite luxury products! Pure Australian jojoba oil.

Its a very high quality carrier oil for essential oils.  Its also luxuriously silky and non-greasy so its well suited as an oil for remedial or relaxation massage oil (with or without essential oils).

Can also be used as a face oil, or to add to body products.

The Australian jojoba we source our oil from is grown in without pesticides.  The oil is cold pressed with no chemicals and filtered to 1 micron.

All the **pure blue essential** 10ml **remedial essential oil blends** contain 30% of this high quality jojoba oil as a carrier oil, so the blends are ready to safely apply to the skin.
