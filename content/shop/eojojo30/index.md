This is one of our favourite luxury products! Pure Australian jojoba oil.  

Jojoba oil is not technically an oil but a liquid wax.  Compared to other seed oils, it has an extremely long shelf life, as it doesn't oxidise like oils.  

Extremely nourishing, with a silky feel and non-greasy, its well suited as the only oil you need for moisturising your face or body.   

Jojoba is perfect to be used as the main ingredient to make your own natural, zero waste skin care products at home.  It also makes a high quality carrier oil for essential oils.

The golden jojoba oil we source is grown in Australia without pesticides.  The liquid wax extract is cold pressed with no chemicals and filtered to 1 micron.  

All our **pure blue essential** 10ml **remedial essential oil blends** contain 30% of this high quality jojoba oil as a carrier oil, so the essential oils are ready to safely apply to the skin. 

Aï»¿lso available in 100mls here.
