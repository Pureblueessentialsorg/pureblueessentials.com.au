**pure blue essentials** is a small Australian company borne out of a need for natural products to supply our own clients.

Jacinda Minahan, the founder of **pure blue essentials**, has a Diploma in Horticulture, a Diploma in Horticulture (Herbs, Medicinal Plants and Essential Oils) and a Diploma in Remedial Massage Therapy.

These two things have combined with over 20 years’ experience in both industries to shape our high quality products.

Our aim is to bring you the best quality, pure, natural products for the essentials of healthy living, at home and on the move, at affordable prices.  Putting natural health care into your own hands.

The ingredients and packaging we use are sourced locally where possible, sustainably and ethically.

We ensure that our products are free of palm oil, animal products, synthetic fragrances and artificial colours.

As our business grows we will always keep your products pure, look for ways to support local business, and contribute greater percentages to charities.



**Why blue???**

The color blue represents both the sky and the sea and is associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, inspiration, productivity and sensitivity.

Blue also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, confidence, stability, faith, and intelligence. *

And isn’t it also just a really great colour !?!

Essential oils need to be protected from light. So when sourcing bottles we chose cobalt blue. A no brainer really. We hope you enjoy our beautiful blue bottles.
