**Packaging and Recycling Policy**



Packaging is unfortunately necessary. So through our packaging we aim to achieve 3 things:

\* To ensure your precious cargo arrives in perfect condition;

\* To have minimal impact on the environment while conducting an ongoing business and meaningful employment;

\* To support sustainable packaging companies; and

\* To save recyclable materials from ending up in landfill.



We use clean cardboard rolls and bubble wrap sourced from the construction industry and the textile industry. These are saved from going to landfill.

Brown paper and packaging peanuts are also used.

If you have packing peanuts (the squidgy white lumps) in your parcel, they can safely be placed in any composting system or placed on the garden and watered in straight away. If you canâ€™t do either of those, it is safe to place them in the kitchen sink and wash them down the drain with ample water.
