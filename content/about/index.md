**pure blue essentials** is a small Australian company borne out of a need for natural health products to supply our own clients.

Jacinda Minahan, the founder of **pure blue essentials**, has a Diploma in Horticulture, a Diploma in Horticulture (Herbs, Medicinal Plants and Essential Oils) and a Diploma in Remedial Massage Therapy.

These two things have combined with over 20 years’ experience in these industries to shape our high quality products.

Our aim is to always bring you high quality, pure, natural products for the essentials of healthy living, at home and on the move, allowing you to take your natural health care into your own hands.

The ingredients and packaging we use are sourced locally where possible, sustainably and ethically.  We ensure that our products are free of palm oil, GMOs, animal products, synthetic fragrances and artificial colours.

As our business grows we will always keep your products pure, look for ways to support local business, and contribute greater percentages to charities.

**Why blue???**

The color blue invokes calm and represents both the sky and the sea. It is the colour associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, inspiration, productivity and sensitivity.  It also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, confidence, stability, faith and intelligence*.  We like to think these are qualities to appreciate in life, and strive for as humans and as a business.

And isn’t it also just a really great colour !?!

Essential oils need to be protected from light.  So when sourcing bottles we chose cobalt blue.  A no brainer really. We hope you enjoy our beautiful blue bottles.
