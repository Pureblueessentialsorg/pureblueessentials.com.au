**pure blue essentials** is a small Australian business borne out of a need for natural health products to supply to remedial massage therapy clients.  

Jacinda Minahan, the founder of **pure blue essentials**, holds a Diploma in Horticulture (Herbs, Medicinal Plants and Essential Oils) and a Diploma in Remedial Massage Therapy.  With a total of over 20 years experience in both sectors, our high quality natural health products have been shaped to support your health needs.

Our aim is to always bring you high quality, pure, natural products for the essentials of healthy living, at home and on the move, allowing you to take your natural health care into your own hands.

The ingredients and packaging we use are sourced locally, sustainably and ethically where possible.  We ensure that our products are always free of palm oil, GMOs, animal products, synthetic fragrances and artificial colours.

As our business grows we will always keep our products pure, look for ways to further support local business, and contribute greater percentages to not-for-profit organisations.

**Why blue???**

The color blue invokes calm and represents both the sky and the sea. It is the colour associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, inspiration, productivity and sensitivity.  It also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, confidence, stability, faith and intelligence*.  We like to think these are qualities to appreciate in life, and strive for as humans and as a business.

And isnâ€™t it also just a really great colour !?!

Essential oils need to be protected from light.  So we chose cobalt blue for our bottles.  A no brainer really. We hope you enjoy our beautiful blue bottles.
