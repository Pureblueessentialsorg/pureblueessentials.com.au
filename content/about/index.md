**pure blue essentials** is a small Australian business created out of a need for natural, sustainable health products to support remedial massage clients.  

Jacinda Minahan, the founder of **pure blue essentials**, holds a Diploma in Horticulture (Herbs, Medicinal Plants and Essential Oils) and a Diploma in Remedial Massage Therapy.  With a total of over 20 years' experience in both sectors, our high quality natural health products have been expertly shaped to support your health needs.

Our aim is to always bring you high quality, pure, natural products for the essentials of healthy living, at home and on the move, allowing you to take your natural health care into your own hands.

Our ingredients and packaging are sourced locally, sustainably and ethically.  Our premises are off-grid and carbon neutral.  The health and wellbeing of our planet is just as important as providing natural health care to humans.

We ensure that our products are *always* free of palm oil, GMOs, animal products, synthetic fragrances and artificial colours.  We only add a high quailty carrier oil (Australian owned and grown jojoba oil) to our 10ml roll-on products, to make it safe to directly apply to  the skin.  In any 30ml essential oil blend there is no carrier oil, it is a combination of 100% pure essential oils that are for the purpose described.

As our business grows we will always keep our products pure, look for ways to further support local business, and contribute greater percentages to not-for-profit organisations.

**Why blue???**

The color blue invokes calm and represents both the sky and the sea. It is the colour associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, inspiration, productivity and sensitivity.  It also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, confidence, stability, faith and intelligence*.  We like to think these are qualities to appreciate in life, and strive for as humans and as a business.

And isn’t it also just a really great colour !?!

Essential oils need to be protected from light.  So we chose cobalt blue for our bottles.  A no brainer really. We hope you enjoy our beautiful blue bottles as much as you enjoy our quality products.
