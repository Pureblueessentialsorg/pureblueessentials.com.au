***What are essential oils?***

Active ingredients found in plants have been used for many centuries to treat common human conditions and ailments. Distilling the essential oil in a plant captures and preserves these potent, active ingredients.

***What is the value of using a remedial essential oil blend?***

Combining active ingredients of different plants will target the complex pain and symptom makeup of an ailment. There is a great a variety of therapeutic grade, pure essential oils in our products, combining the effective qualities of different plants for maximum potency.

For example:

* Cedarwood and frankincense in a [bath soak](/shop/heat-packs-and-bath-soaks/).
* Lavender and lemongrass in a [magnesium spray](/shop/magnesium-rubs-and-fisiocrem/) for tired, aching, or cramping muscles.
* Lavender and peppermint included in a remedial essential oil blend for [headaches](/shop/remedial-essential-oil-blends/).

* Oregano oil, together with turmeric and ginger oil included in a blend for [arthritis pain](/shop/remedial-essential-oil-blends/).
* Clove oil combined with eucalyptus, cinnamon and lemon included in a potent antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal formula called [Four Thieves](/shop/remedial-essential-oil-blends/).
* Helichrysum, Vitamin E and tea tree oils included in a [wound care](/shop/remedial-essential-oil-blends/) blend.

If youâ€™re not sure where to start, think about whether you want a remedial blend to use on your skin (10ml roll-ons) or with an essential oil diffuser (30ml bottle with dropper). If you want both, choose the [value pack](/shop/gift-packs-and-value-bundles/) which contains a 10ml remedial blend, a 30ml remedial blend and a 30ml jojoba oil as a high quality carrier oil. 

We believe optimal health and youngliving is possible, no matter what your age.
